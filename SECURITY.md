# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the code running on the "main" branch and "development" branch of this repository. This is supported in addition to those formal releases, but note anything not yet released should be treated as in-development.

In terms of plugin releases, our support matrix is as follows:

### Actively Supported
Our team currently supports the following versions, so you may expect security patches where appropriate for these versions.

| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 2021.09             | :white_check_mark: | No Earlier than December 2021    |

### Legacy Supported
These versions are no longer under active development, however we will look to release critical security patches where appropriate.
